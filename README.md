# Health Insurance Claim Denier

An incremental game about denying health insurance claims. ðŸš«

This is a satirical take on [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) that plays off the absurdities of [semi-automated denials in the healthcare insurance industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigna#Automatically_rejecting_claims_with_no_review).

## Technical Details
